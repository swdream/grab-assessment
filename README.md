# Setup Wordpress and monitoring system on Ubuntu 16.04

Note:
- This ansible repo only works for Ubuntu 16.04
- In this case, I install WordPress and monitoring system on a same server.

Main components are used:

- [MySQL Database](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/)
- [PHP](http://php.net/docs.php)
- [Nginx](https://nginx.org/en/docs/)
- [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/)
- [Java](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/)
- [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [Graylog2](http://docs.graylog.org/en/2.4/)
- [Telegraf](https://docs.influxdata.com/telegraf)
- [InfluxDB](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb)
- [Grafana](http://docs.grafana.org/)

## Preparation

### Server

- Create a VM with at least 4 Gb memory. In this case, I created a VM on [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)
 for this test.

### Email

- An Email which will be used by `Graylog2` and `Grafana` for notification, alerts.

### DNS

- Create a record A that point to your VM. In this case, I created a `grabtest.swdream.org` record.
IP of VM can also be used if the record is NOT created.

### Requirements

- Python3
- Ansible 2.0 or higher

## How this Ansible environment work

### Setup your ssh conf on the machine where you run ansible-playbook

Add below line to `~/.ssh/config`

```
Host assessment
    Hostname IP_or_domain_name_of_your_VM
    User your_user
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/your_private_key
    Port 22
    UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
    StrictHostKeyChecking no
    PasswordAuthentication no
    IdentitiesOnly yes
    LogLevel FATAL
```

### Modify Ansible Variables

All needed  variables will be explained in following sessions. Modify them to suit your case.

### Apply Ansible playbook to setup WordPress and monitoring system

Running

```
$ ./ansible-playbook assessment
```

Or

```
$ ansible-playbook -i environments/assessment assessment.yml
```
